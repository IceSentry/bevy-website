Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), we're happy to announce the **Bevy 0.12** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

## Wireframe Improvements

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @IceSentry</div>

The wireframes now use bevy's Material abstraction. This means it will automatically use the new batching and instancing features while being easier to maintain. This change also made it easier to add support for colored wireframe. You can configure the color globally or per mesh using the `WireframeColor` component. It's also now possible to disable wireframe rendering by using the `NeverRenderWireframe` component.
